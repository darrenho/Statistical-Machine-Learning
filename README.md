# Statistical-Machine-Learning
This GitHub site contains the course materials for Statistical Machine Learning
that I taught at Colorado State University Spring 2014.  

Though it is an unstructured repository, my hope is that it will be useful to 
researchers, students, or professors in some capacity.  Please do not use the
materials for commercial purposes.
